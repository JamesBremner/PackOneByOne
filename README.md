# PackOneByOne

A bin packing algorithm often is presented with a set of items and a set of containers into which the items have to be packed.

Here, there is a container and the items arrive one by one with no look ahead allowed.

So the items are packed into the container as well as possible, which means that they will often end up in non optimal locations with gaps between the items.  When an item arrives that cannot be fitted into the container, the previously packed items may be moved to accomodate the new arrival

Here is a video of the one by one packer in operation:
